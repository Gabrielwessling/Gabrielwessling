👋 GUD DAY SIR, HERE IS ME, ME IS GABRIEL MFing WESSLING, a.k.a. AKIRA!
- 👀 I'm interested in mmorpgs, documentaries on youtube (or any 2 hour video that doesn't add a shit to my life), strange games and strange shit in games and micromanaging rimworld more than I micromanage my life. Also VR is fucking real life, we're living the matrix outside it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning absolutely nothing that adds up to my life. I'm getting good in puzzles tho, but I don't like them very much.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really, I'd love to help, even if I have to learn a lot before starting, so feel free to email me or something like that.
- 📫 You can contact me via e-mail at distopiarte@gmail.com or send me a message at +55(47)99734-9359. Also my twitter but I don't recommend: @gabee_dev or https://twitter.com/gabee_dev

Any english mistake here is deliberate so don't bother correcting em.
