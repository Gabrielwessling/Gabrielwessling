👋 GUD DAY SIR, HERE IS ME, ME IS GABRIEL, a.k.a. AKIRA!
- 👀 I'm interested in mmorpgs, documentaries on youtube (or any 2 hour video that doesn't add to my life), strange games and strange shit in games and also micromanaging rimworld more than I micromanage my life. Also VR is real life, we're living the matrix outside of it.
- 🌱 Currently learning software engineering and astrophisics, but I'm very interested in philosofy and sociology, and will always try to learn more about these subjects. I'm getting good in puzzles too, but I don't like them very much.
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate in anything really, I'd love to help, even if I have to learn a lot before starting, so feel free to email me or something like that.
- 📫 You can contact me via e-mail at distopiarte@gmail.com or send me a message at +55(47)99734-9359. Also my twitter but I don't recommend: @gabee_dev or https://twitter.com/gabee_dev
- 👨‍💻 Currently working with a team on a PSX Horror game 👾👹. I'm mainly programming but also writing and level designing.


Any english mistake here is deliberate (but some aren't and that's ok) so don't bother correcting em.
