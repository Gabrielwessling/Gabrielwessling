👋 Name's Gabriel Wessling, or Gabe Weslin for the mais chegados.

### Collaboration
- 💞️ Open to collaborating on any project, even if it requires significant learning.
- 💞️ Feel free to reach out via:
  - 📫 Email: distopiarte@gmail.com - I receive a lot of junk so name your subject with "[GitHub]"
### Professional Experience
- 👨‍💻 Not working with a team on an Isometric post-apocalyptic RPG anymore, that just failed.
- 👨‍💻 Roles include programming, writing, and level designing, some 3D modeling, but I'm bad at it, so I just slap the psx retro tag and say that it's planned.
Looking forward to connecting and collaborating with you!
